# C++ Capstone Project Description: Ball Chaser OOP

For completion of the C++ capstone project I have chosen to apply object oriented principles (OOP) to the 'GoChaseIt!' project completed as a part of the 'Robotics Software Engineer' Nanodegree program. The 'GoChaseIt!' project called for the implementation of a ball chaser application in which a custom robot placed in a custom gazebo world detects and follows a white ball in it's field of view. The app employs 2 ROS nodes and 1 service (server and client) to achieve the necessary communication between the main process, the robot motor controller, and camera input used for detection. The manner in which these elements are implemented in the course project does not make use of various object-oriented princpiles, which is my capstone submission will attempt to rectify.

## What is different
The basic functionality of the application is unchanged, however node/service handling and callbacks have been structured in classes ProcessImage and DriveBot class BallChaser. 

The previously submitted 'GoChaseIt!' project can be found here: https://github.com/kyle-stanhouse/GoChaseIt. The following project criteria addressed does not include tasks performed for the previous project.

**The following criteria/specifications from the Capstone rubric are met.**

**Criteria:** _The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques._\
**Meets Specifications:** _The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks._
**Explanation:** There are now two classes that contain the necessary nodes, services, and callbacks, namely ProcessImage and DriveBot. Each contains class attributes and methods and is separated into header and source files.

**Criteria:** Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.\
**Meets Specifications:** All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected, or private.\
**Explanation:** There are private and public data members specified.

**Criteria:** Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.\
**Meets Specifications:** All class members that are set to argument values are initialized through member initialization lists.\
**Explanation:** The public and private node handles are initialized in the constructor via a member initialization list.

**Criteria:** Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.\
**Meets Specifications:** All class member functions document their effects, either through function names, comments, or formal documentation. Member functions do not change program state in undocumented ways.\
**Explanation:** Member variables and functions are documented through comments. There is however no 'interface' so to speak that allows a user to access or mutate data members. 

**Criteria:** Classes encapsulate behavior.\
**Meets Specifications:** Appropriate data and functions are grouped into classes. Member data that is subject to an invariant is hidden from the user. State is accessed via member functions.\
**Explanation:** Encapsulation is perhaps the main benefit of applying object-oriented principles to the 'GoChaseIt!' project. The user only needs to initialize the node and create the node handle and is spared the rest of the details. There however aren't currently any accessors or mutators.

**Criteria:** The project makes use of references in function declarations.\
**Meets Specifications:** At least two variables are defined as references, or two functions use pass-by-reference in the project code.\
**Explanation:** Nodehandles for the two processes are passed to the 2 classes by reference. Additionally, the _process_image_callback_ function accepts the camera image messages _img_ by reference.

**Potential criteria met**

**Criteria:** The project uses destructors appropriately.\
**Meets Specifications:** At least one class that uses unmanaged dynamically allocated memory, along with any class that otherwise needs to modify state upon the termination of an object, uses a destructor.\
**Explanation:** While there is currently no dynamically allocated memory, a destructor has been added for the ros::init() handler. `ctrl-c` can be used ostensibly to terminate the program, however in truth it doesn't happen immediately in the event that logging is employed.

**Have yet to implement, don't plan on it for this submission**

**Criteria:** The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.\
**Meets Specifications:** The project uses at least one smart pointer: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, or weak_ptr. The project does not use raw pointers.\
**Explanation:**

**Criteria:** The project uses multithreading.\
**Meets Specifications:** The project uses multiple threads in the execution.
**Explanation:**

* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

* Create a `catkin_ws`
`$ mkdir -p /home/workspace/catkin_ws/`
`$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src`
`$ catkin_init_workspace`
 
 test this in project workspace

Observe the robot follow the ball as you move it around the gazebo world. 
The robot will stop when the white ball is not in it's field of view.
